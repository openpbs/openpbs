 *
 * @par Synopsis:
 *	unsigned char disruc(int stream, int *<retval>)
 *
 *	Gets a Data-is-Strings unsigned integer from <stream>, converts it into
 *	an unsigned char, and returns it.  The unsigned integer in <stream>
 *	consists of a counted string of digits, starting with a zero, which
 *	represents the number.  If the number doesn't lie between 0 and 9,
 *	inclusive, it is preceeded by at least one count.
 *
 *	This format for character strings representing unsigned integers can
 *	best be understood through the decoding algorithm:
 *
 *	1. Initialize the digit count to 1.
 *
 *	2. Read the next digit; if it is a plus sign, go to step (4); if it
 *	   is a minus sign, post an error.
 *
 *	3. Decode a new count from the digit decoded in step (2) and the next
 *	   count - 1 digits; repeat step (2).
 *
 *	4. Decode the next count digits as the unsigned integer.
 *
 *	*<retval> gets DIS_SUCCESS if everything works well.  It gets an error
 *	code otherwise.  In case of an error, the <stream> character pointer is
 *	reset, making it possible to retry with some other conversion strategy.
