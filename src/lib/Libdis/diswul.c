 * @par Synopsis:
 *	int diswul(int stream, unsigned long value)
 *
 *	Converts <value> into a Data-is-Strings unsigned integer and sends it to
 *	<stream>.
 *
 *	This format for character strings representing unsigned integers can
 *	best be understood through the decoding algorithm:
 *
 *	1. Initialize the digit count to 1.
 *
 *	2. Read the next character; if it is a plus sign, go to step (4); if it
 *	   is a minus sign, post an error.
 *
 *	3. Decode a new count from the digit decoded in step (2) and the next
 *	   count - 1 digits; repeat step (2).
 *
 *	4. Decode the next count digits as the unsigned integer.
 *
 *	Returns DIS_SUCCESS if everything works well.  Returns an error code
 *	otherwise.  In case of an error, no characters are sent to <stream>.
