 *	int disrfst(int stream, size_t achars, char *value)
 *
 *	Gets a Data-is-Strings character string from <stream> and converts it
 *	into an ASCII NUL-terminated string, and puts the string into <value>,
 *	a pre-allocated string, <achars> long.  The character string in <stream>
 *	consists of an unsigned integer, followed by a number of characters
 *	determined by the unsigned integer.
 *
 *	Disrfst returns DIS_SUCCESS if everything works well.  It returns an
 *	error code otherwise.  In case of an error, the <stream> character
 *	pointer is reset, making it possible to retry with some other conversion
 *	strategy, and the first character of <value> is set to ASCII NUL.
