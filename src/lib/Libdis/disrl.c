 *
 *	Gets a Data-is-Strings floating point number from <stream> and converts
 *	it into a long double and returns it.  The number from <stream> consists
 *	of two consecutive signed integers.  The first is the coefficient, with
 *	its implied decimal point at the low-order end.  The second is the
 *	exponent as a power of 10.
 *
 *	*<retval> gets DIS_SUCCESS if everything works well.  It gets an error
 *	code otherwise.  In case of an error, the <stream> character pointer is
 *	reset, making it possible to retry with some other conversion strategy.
 *
 *	By fiat of the author, neither loss of significance nor underflow are
 *	errors.
