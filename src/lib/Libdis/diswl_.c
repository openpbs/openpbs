 * @par Synopsis:
 * 	int diswl_(int stream, dis_long_double_t value, unsigned int ndigs)
 *
 *	Converts <value> into a Data-is-Strings floating point number and sends
 *	it to <stream>.  The converted number consists of two consecutive signed
 *	integers.  The first is the coefficient, at most <ndigs> long, with its
 *	implied decimal point at the low-order end.  The second is the exponent
 *	as a power of 10.
 *
 *	This function is only invoked through the macros, diswf, diswd, and
 *	diswl, which are defined in the header file, dis.h.
 *
 *	Returns DIS_SUCCESS if everything works well.  Returns an error code
 *	otherwise.  In case of an error, no characters are sent to <stream>.
