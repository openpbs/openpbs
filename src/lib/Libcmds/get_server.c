 * @brief
 * ------------------------------------
 * As specified in section 5 of the ERS:
 *
 *  5.1.2.  Directing Requests to Correct Server
 *
 *  A  command  shall  perform  its  function  by  sending   the
 *  corresponding  request  for  service  to the a batch server.
 *  The choice of batch servers to which to send the request  is
 *  governed by the following ordered set of rules:
 *
 *  1. For those commands which require or accept a job identif-
 *     ier  operand, if the server is specified in the job iden-
 *     tifier operand as @server, then the batch  requests  will
 *     be sent to the server named by server.
 *
 *  2. For those commands which require or accept a job identif-
 *     ier  operand  and  the @server is not specified, then the
 *     command will attempt to determine the current location of
 *     the  job  by  sending  a  Locate Job batch request to the
 *     server which created the job.
 *
 *  3. If a server component of a destination  is  supplied  via
 *     the  -q  option,  such  as  on  qsub and qselect, but not
 *     qalter, then the server request is sent to that server.
 *
 *  4. The server request is sent to the  server  identified  as
 *     the default server, see section 2.6.3.
 *     [pbs_connect() implements this]
 *
 *  2.6.3.  Default Server
 *
 *  When a server is not specified to a client, the client  will
 *  send  batch requests to the server identified as the default
 *  server.  A client identifies the default server by  (a)  the
 *  setting  of  the environment variable PBS_DEFAULT which con-
 *  tains a destination, or (b) the  destination  in  the  batch
 *  administrator established file {PBS_DIR}/default_destn.
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 * Takes a job_id_in string as input, calls parse_jobid to separate
 * the pieces, then applies the above rules in order
 * If things go OK, the function value is set to 0,
 * if errors, it is set to 1.
 *
 * @par Full legal syntax is:
 *  seq_number[.parent_server[:port]][@current_server[:port]]
 *
