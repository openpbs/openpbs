 *	even when there are no attropl entries in the list.
 *
 * @par Each individual entry is then encoded as:
 *		u int	size of the three strings (name, resource, value)
 *			including the terminating nulls
 *		string	attribute name
 *		u int	1 or 0 if resource name does or does not follow
 *		string	resource name (if one)
 *		string  value of attribute/resource
 *		u int	"op" of attrlop
 * @note
 *	the encoding of a attropl is the same as the encoding of
 *	the pbs_ifl.h structures "attrl" and the server svrattrl.  Any
 *	one of the three forms can be decoded into any of the three with the
 *	possible loss of the "flags" field (which is the "op" of the attrlop).
