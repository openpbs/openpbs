/**
 * @brief
 * 	LTostr - returns a pointer to the character string representation of the
 *	Long number, value, represented in base, base.
 *
 *	If base is outside its domain of 2 through the number of characters in
 *	the Long_dig array, uLTostr returns a zero-length string and sets errno
 *	to EDOM.
 *
 * 	The string is stored in a static array and will be clobbered the next
 *	time either LTostr or uLTostr is called.  The price of eliminating the
 * 	possibility of memory leaks is the necessity to copy the string
 *	immediately to a safe place if it must last.
 *
 * @param[in] value - Long value
 * @param[in] base - base representation of val
 *
 * @return	string
 * @retval	char reprsn of Long	Success
 * @retval	NULL			error
