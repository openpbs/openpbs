/**
 * @file	qterm.c
 * @brief
 *  The qterm command terminates the batch server.
 *
 * @par	Synopsis:
 *  qterm [-t type] [-F|-f|-i] [-s] [-m] [server ...]
 *
 * @par	Options:
 *  -t  delay   Jobs are (1) checkpointed if possible; otherwise, (2) jobs are
 *		rerun (requeued) if possible; otherwise, (3) jobs are left to
 *              run.
 *
 *      immediate
 *              Jobs are (1) checkpointed if possible; otherwise, (2) jobs are
 *		rerun if possible; otherwise, (3) jobs are aborted.
 *
 *	quick (the new default)
 *		The server will save state and exit leaving running jobs
 *		still running.  Good for shutting down when you wish to
 *		quickly restart the server.
 *
 *  -F	shutdonw the Secndary Server only (Primary stays up),
 *  -f  shutdown Secondary Servers as well, or
 *  -i	idle the Secondary Server
 *
 *  -s	shutdown scheduler as well
 *
 *  -m  shutdown Moms also
 *
 * @par	Arguments:
 *  server ...
 *      A list of servers to terminate.
