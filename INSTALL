How to install PBS Pro using the configure script.

1. Install the prerequisite packages for building PBS Pro.

  For CentOS systems you should run the following command as root:

    yum install -y gcc make rpm-build libtool hwloc-devel \
      libX11-devel libXt-devel libedit-devel libical-devel \
      ncurses-devel perl postgresql-devel python-devel tcl-devel \
      tk-devel swig expat-devel openssl-devel libXext libXft

  For openSUSE systems you should run the following command as root:

    zypper install gcc make rpm-build libtool hwloc-devel \
      libX11-devel libXt-devel libedit-devel libical-devel \
      ncurses-devel perl postgresql-devel python-devel tcl-devel \
      tk-devel swig libexpat-devel libopenssl-devel libXext-devel \
      libXft-devel fontconfig
      
  For Debian systems you should run the following command as root:      
  
    sudo apt-get install gcc make libtool libhwloc-dev libX11-dev \
      libXt-dev libedit-dev libical-dev ncurses-dev perl \
      postgresql-server-dev-all python-dev tcl-dev tk-dev swig \
      libexpat-dev libssl-dev libxext-dev libxft-dev

2. Install the prerequisite packages for running PBS Pro. In addition
  to the commands below, you should also install a text editor of
  your choosing (vim, emacs, gedit, etc.).

  For CentOS systems you should run the following command as root:

    yum install -y expat libedit postgresql-server python \
      sendmail sudo tcl tk libical

  For openSUSE systems you should run the following command as root:

    zypper install expat libedit postgresql-server python \
      sendmail sudo tcl tk libical1
      
  For Debian systems you should run the following command as root:

    apt-get install expat libedit2 postgresql python sendmail-bin \
      sudo tcl tk libical1a

3. Open a terminal as a normal (non-root) user, unpack the PBS Pro
  tarball, and cd to the package directory.

    tar -xpvf pbspro-14.0.1.tar.gz
    cd pbspro-14.0.1

4. Display the available build parameters.

    ./configure --help

5. Configure the build for your environment. You may utilize the
  parameters displayed in the previous step. (See notes 1 and 2
  below)

  For CentOS systems you should run the following command:

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/pbs

  For openSUSE systems (see note 4 below) you should run the
  following command:

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/pbs --libexecdir=/opt/pbs/libexec
    
  For Debian systems you should run the following command:

    ./configure --prefix=/opt/pbs

6. Build PBS Pro by running "make". (See note 3 below)

    make

7. Configure sudo to allow your user account to run commands as
  root. Refer to the online manual pages for sudo, sudoers, and
  visudo.

8. Install PBS Pro. Use sudo to run the command as root.

    sudo make install

9. Configure PBS Pro by executing the post-install script.

    sudo /opt/pbs/libexec/pbs_postinstall

10. Edit /etc/pbs.conf to configure the PBS Pro services that
  should be started. If you are installing PBS Pro on only
  one system, you should change the value of PBS_START_MOM
  from zero to one. If you use vi as your editor, you would
  run:

    sudo vi /etc/pbs.conf

11. Some file permissions must be modified to add SUID privilege.

    sudo chmod 4755 /opt/pbs/sbin/pbs_iff /opt/pbs/sbin/pbs_rcp

12. Start the PBS Pro services.

    sudo /etc/init.d/pbs start

13. All configured PBS services should now be running. Update
  your PATH and MANPATH variables by sourcing the appropriate
  PBS Pro profile or logging out and back in.

  For Bourne shell (or similar) run the following:
    . /etc/profile.d/pbs.sh

  For C shell (or similar) run the following:
    source /etc/profile.d/pbs.csh

14. You should now be able to run PBS Pro commands to submit
  and query jobs. Some examples follow.

bash$ qstat -B

NOTES:

Note 1: It is advisable to create a simple shell script
  that calls configure with the appropriate options so that you
  can save typing on reconfigures. If you have already run configure
  you can remake all of the Makefiles by running "./config.status".
  Also, looking at the first few lines of config.status will
  tell you the options that were set when configure was run.

Note 2: If you modify configure.ac or adjust timestamps on any files
  that are automatically generated, you will need to install the GNU
  autoconf and automake packages in order for configure to
  regenerate those files.

Note 3: You need to use a POSIX (or nearly POSIX) make. GNU make
  works quite well in this regard; BSD make does not. If you are
  having any sort of build problems, your make should be a prime
  suspect. Tremendous effort has been expended to provide proper
  dependency generation and makefiles without relying on any
  non-POSIX features. The build should work fine with a simple call
  to make, however, complicating things by using various make flags
  is not guaranteed to work. Don't be surprised if the first thing
  that make does is call configure again.

Note 4: The openSUSE rpm package expands %_libexecdir to /opt/pbs/lib
  rather than /opt/pbs/libexec which causes problems for the post-
  install scripts. Providing the --libexecdir value to configure 
  overrides this behavior.
