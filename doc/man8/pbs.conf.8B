.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I /etc/pbs.conf

To specify an alternate location for

you may set 
.I PBS_CONF_FILE in your environment.

.IP PBS_LOCALLOG    
Enables logging to local PBS log files.

.IP PBS_MAIL_HOST_NAME      
Used in addressing mail regarding jobs and reservations that is sent
to users specified in a job or reservation's Mail_Users attribute.
Optional.  Must be a fully qualified domain name.  Cannot contain a
colon (":").  

.IP PBS_MANAGER_SERVICE_PORT

.IP PBS_OUTPUT_HOST_NAME 
Host to which all job standard output and

on a job
submission host, the value of PBS_OUTPUT_HOST_NAME is used in the host
portion of the job's 
.I Output_Path 
and 
.I Error_Path 
attributes.  If the
job submitter does not specify paths for standard output and standard
error, the current working directory for the 
.I qsub 
command is used, and
the value of PBS_OUTPUT_HOST_NAME is appended after an at sign ("@").
If the job submitter specifies only a file path for standard output
and standard error, the value of PBS_OUTPUT_HOST_NAME is appended
after an at sign ("@").  If the job submitter specifies paths for
standard output and standard error that include host names, the
specified paths are used.  Optional.  Must be a fully qualified domain
